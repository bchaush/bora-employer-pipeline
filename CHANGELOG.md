## 2026-08-26 — Schema Milestone 1

**Reason**

Establish canonical Draft 2020-12 JSON Schemas and behavioral smoke tests for the first core structured records before production feature work.

**Changed**

* Added `schemas/job.schema.json` with:

  * separate `discovered_date`, `date_first_seen`, `board_posted_date`, and `date_last_verified`;
  * independent `role_status` (freshness) and `source_verification_status` (direct-source) axes;
  * locked E-Verify vocabulary that rejects `NOT_ENROLLED`.
* Added `schemas/requirement.schema.json`.
* Added `schemas/evidence.schema.json`.
* Added behavioral smoke tests:

  * `tests/job_schema_smoke_test.py`
  * `tests/requirement_schema_smoke_test.py`
  * `tests/evidence_schema_smoke_test.py`

**Affected Areas**

* schemas;
* validators / smoke tests;
* job freshness and source-verification data model.

**Risks / Tradeoffs**

* `source_verification_status` values are implementation vocabulary, not Blueprint-locked terminology.
* Fabricated-outcome / unsupported-metric protection is intentionally not enforced by JSON Schema; it belongs in a later deterministic claim/outcome validator.
* URI format checking in the job smoke test uses a registered stdlib checker because default `jsonschema` `FormatChecker` omits `uri` without optional extras.

**Tests / Verification**

All three smoke tests passed:

* `python tests/job_schema_smoke_test.py`
* `python tests/requirement_schema_smoke_test.py`
* `python tests/evidence_schema_smoke_test.py`

## 2026-08-25 — Workbench Initialization

### Added

* Initialized Git repository.
* Added canonical `BLUEPRINT.md`.
* Added `AGENTS.md` operating contract.
* Added `CURRENT_STATE.md`.

### Blueprint Hardening

Added or reinforced:

* external market-softness diagnostic handling;
* `LEGAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` boundary for unresolved consequential immigration/work-authorization interpretation;
* strict JSON Schema validation before structured AI output reaches downstream rendering or production components.

### Architecture Status

Locked tool roles:

* ChatGPT — architecture, research, semantic reasoning, quality decisions
* Cursor — primary implementation and repository agent
* Gemini — independent verifier and backup
* Claude — optional escalation/review only

### Current Status

Workbench setup in progress.

No production features or external integrations have been built yet.
