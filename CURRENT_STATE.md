# Bora Employer Pipeline OS — Current State

Updated: 2026-08-26

## Current Phase

Governing Blueprint: **Final Locked Blueprint v3.1**.

AI/tool operating-model governance synchronization = **CLOSED**.

Claim Validation hardening = **CLOSED**.

Winter Walk Evidence Repository v1 Batch 1 = **CLOSED** (12 evidence records committed).

No reusable claims created yet.

Repository-Level Evidence Integrity = **NOT STARTED / NEXT**.

No production engine yet.

## Completed

* Locked Blueprint loaded into repository; governing version now **v3.1**.
* Blueprint hardenings added for:

  * market-softness diagnostic handling;
  * legal verification boundaries;
  * strict structured-output schema validation.
* Git repository initialized.
* `AGENTS.md` created and locked.
* Cursor selected as the primary builder.
* ChatGPT selected as primary architect/research/reasoning/sequencing and final-decision-guidance layer.
* Claude Code designated as independent coding/evidence reviewer, milestone auditor, and harder-code escalation.
* Gemini designated as occasional non-coding strategic/directional/research second opinion only (not part of the coding execution or coding-review loop).
* AI/tool operating-model governance sync closed:

  * synchronized `BLUEPRINT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`, `GEMINI.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`;
  * Blueprint bumped v3.0 → v3.1;
  * `CLAUDE.md` retained as minimal Claude Code reviewer/auditor instructions pointing to `BLUEPRINT.md`;
  * no production architecture or evidence semantics changed.
* Schema Milestone 1 closed:

  * `schemas/job.schema.json`, `schemas/requirement.schema.json`, and `schemas/evidence.schema.json` complete.
  * `discovered_date` stored separately from `date_first_seen` (also preserves `board_posted_date` and `date_last_verified`).
  * `source_verification_status` split from `role_status` freshness.
  * Shared deterministic job-url validator centralized in `src/job_url_format.py` (`format: "job-url"`).
  * Shared Draft 2020-12 schema validator helper in `src/schema_validation.py` always attaches the job-url FormatChecker (prevents silent skip via plain `FormatChecker()`).
  * Job URLs accept http/https; reject credentials, bad schemes, empty host, and literal whitespace/control characters; percent-encoded paths remain valid.
  * Behavioral smoke tests for all three schemas under `tests/` — all passing.
* Claim Validation milestone closed (including post-close hardening):

  * `schemas/claim.schema.json` built.
  * Lineage validator built (`src/claim_lineage.py`).
  * State compatibility validator built (`src/claim_state_validation.py`).
  * Unified `validate_claim()` built (`src/claim_validation.py`).
  * Claim validation is citation-scoped: only Evidence_IDs cited by the claim affect claim validity.
  * Context conflicts (`allowed_contexts` ∩ `forbidden_contexts`) block reusable use via `CONTEXT_CONFLICT`.
  * Sequence duplicate Evidence_IDs intentionally fail closed as repository identity-integrity protection (including uncited duplicates in sequence-form indexes).
  * All 7 related test suites pass.
  * Post-close hardening: regression coverage for uncited sequence duplicates and CONTRADICTED claim-state non-reuse; evidence schema validator construction hoisted outside per-ID loop (no behavior change).
* Winter Walk Evidence Repository v1 Batch 1 closed:

  * 12 evidence records committed under `evidence/winter_walk/` (`WW_ARCH_001`, `WW_ARCH_002`, `WW_CTRL_001`, `WW_CTRL_002`, `WW_MAP_001`, `WW_ADOPT_001`, `WW_DATA_001`, `WW_DATA_002`, `WW_CONN_001`, `WW_SYNC_001`, `WW_FUQ_001`, `WW_TEST_001`).
  * Provenance-first extraction from current Apps Script (`CODES-UP TO DATE.txt`), Boston 2027 Workbook A/B exports, and locked `WinterWalk_Master_Blueprint.docx`.
  * Independent Claude Code semantic audit completed.
  * Three review corrections applied (`WW_DATA_001`, `WW_DATA_002`, `WW_TEST_001` capabilities/limitations).
  * Final residual wording fix applied (`WW_TEST_001` notes: PII absence check).
  * All 12 records pass evidence schema validation; all 7 existing test suites pass.
  * No open Batch 1 findings.
  * No reusable claims created; schemas and validators unchanged by Batch 1.

## Current Task

Next approved technical milestone: `REPOSITORY_LEVEL_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY` — **NOT STARTED**.

## Not Built Yet

* Repository-wide evidence integrity validator (**NEXT**)
* Winter Walk Evidence Batch 2+
* Claims derived from Winter Walk evidence
* Forbidden-claim registry implementation
* Deterministic fabricated-outcome / metric validators
* Production pipeline engine
* Job ingestion
* Job deduplication
* Role verification workflow
* Job requirement extraction
* OPT/work-authorization screening
* Evidence matching
* Fit routing
* Resume patch generation
* Resume rendering
* Resume diff review
* Networking research
* Application tracking
* Google Workspace integration
* External job-source integrations
* Automated monitoring

## Current Safety State

* No production application automation exists.
* No external integrations are connected.
* No job applications can be submitted automatically.
* No resume-generation pipeline exists yet.
* No reusable claims exist yet; Batch 1 evidence alone does not authorize resume wording.
* Winter Walk Batch 1 preserves UNKNOWN for daily production use, completed handoff, measured business impact, and live email sending unless separately evidenced.
* No runtime workflow depends on multi-model agreement; deterministic validators enforce invariants; evidence wins over model opinion; Bora retains consequential approval.
* No PII should be stored in this repository unless explicitly designed and approved later.
* No architectural dependency beyond the local repository has been approved.
* JSON Schema gates reject malformed structured records.
* Claim reusable-use requires schema + citation-scoped lineage + state compatibility + human approval + non-UNKNOWN/non-CONTRADICTED state + no context conflict.
* Semantic fabricated-outcome protection remains a later deterministic validator layer.
* Repository-Level Evidence Integrity does **not** exist yet.

## Current Source of Truth

`BLUEPRINT.md` (**Final Locked Blueprint v3.1**)

If another project file conflicts with the Blueprint, stop and surface the conflict.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. `REPOSITORY_LEVEL_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY` (next approved technical milestone; not started)
2. Forbidden-claim registry (after or with evidence integrity, only if approved)
3. Winter Walk Evidence Batch 2 (only if explicitly approved)
4. Additional schemas only as explicitly approved

## Do Not Start Yet

Do not begin:

* Evidence Integrity until this governance closeout commit is complete and the next task is explicitly confirmed in-session if required;
* Winter Walk Batch 2 without explicit approval;
* claim creation from Batch 1 evidence without explicit approval;
* job scraping;
* job-board integrations;
* Google Sheets integration;
* Gmail integration;
* resume tailoring;
* AI job scoring;
* application automation;
* LinkedIn automation;
* MCP configuration;
* database selection;
* cloud infrastructure;
* production API integrations.

These begin only after the governed workbench is complete and the first implementation phase is approved.

## Next Approved Task

`REPOSITORY_LEVEL_EVIDENCE_INTEGRITY` — approved as next technical milestone; **not implemented yet**.
